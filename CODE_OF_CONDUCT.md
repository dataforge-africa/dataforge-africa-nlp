# Code of Conduct
## DataForge Africa NLP

## Our Commitment

DataForge Africa is committed to building **inclusive, respectful, and trustworthy language infrastructure for Africa**.

We recognize that language is deeply tied to:
- identity
- culture
- dignity
- power

This project exists to **uplift**, not erase, African voices.  
Participation in this community requires care, humility, and responsibility.

---

## Expected Behavior

All contributors, maintainers, and participants are expected to:

- Treat all languages, dialects, and communities with respect
- Engage in good faith, constructive discussion
- Be open to feedback and correction
- Value learning over ego
- Explain decisions clearly and patiently
- Prioritize collective progress over personal recognition

Disagreement is acceptable.  
Disrespect is not.

---

## Respect for Language and Culture

The following are **not tolerated**:

- Dismissing African languages as “low-resource”, “simple”, or “inferior”
- Treating linguistic variation as an error rather than a reality
- Imposing foreign norms without cultural or linguistic justification
- Mocking spelling, accents, or informal language use
- Speaking over community members or learners

Language diversity is a strength, not a problem to be “fixed”.

---

## Inclusivity and Accessibility

We strive to create a space that is welcoming to:

- learners at all levels
- contributors from rural and under-resourced contexts
- educators, researchers, and practitioners
- people using limited connectivity or hardware

Contributors should:
- write clear, readable code
- avoid unnecessary jargon
- document assumptions
- explain context when possible

Accessibility is part of quality.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Harassment, discrimination, or demeaning language
- Racist, sexist, or culturally dismissive remarks
- Personal attacks or intimidation
- Gatekeeping or elitism
- Deliberate misrepresentation of others’ work
- Aggressive or hostile communication

Such behavior undermines trust and will not be tolerated.

---

## Responsibility in AI and Language Systems

Given the impact of language systems, contributors must:

- Avoid promoting harmful or misleading outputs
- Respect safety, especially in education and public service contexts
- Avoid overclaiming capabilities
- Clearly document limitations and failure cases

We prefer a system that says *“I don’t know”*  
over one that confidently misleads.

---

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

- Raise the concern privately with the project maintainers
- Provide context and evidence where possible
- Expect concerns to be handled respectfully and confidentially

Maintainers may take actions including:
- requesting changes
- issuing warnings
- restricting participation
- removing contributions
- banning repeat or severe offenders

Enforcement decisions are guided by:
- impact on the community
- alignment with project values
- commitment to long-term trust

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- GitHub repositories
- issues and pull requests
- discussions and reviews
- documentation and examples
- all project-related communication spaces

Participation in any of these spaces implies agreement with this Code.

---

## Closing Statement

DataForge Africa NLP is not just about technology.

It is about:
- respect
- responsibility
- stewardship
- and building systems that Africans can trust

We expect everyone involved to act accordingly.
